Use context more
As the officials say about it, Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.

So if you have multiple components that needs a value then use context. If you have only a single child component that needs this value use compositions.

Certainly! Here's an example to illustrate the usage of Context in React:

```jsx
// 1. Create a context
const MyContext = React.createContext();

// 2. Create a provider component
const MyProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const value = "Hello, world!"; // The value to be shared through context

  return (
    <MyContext.Provider value={value}>
      {children}
    </MyContext.Provider>
  );
};

// 3. Create child components that consume the context
const ChildComponent1 = () => {
  const value = React.useContext(MyContext); // Access the context value

  return <p>{value}</p>;
};

const ChildComponent2 = () => {
  const value = React.useContext(MyContext); // Access the context value

  return <p>{value}</p>;
};

// 4. Use the context provider to wrap the child components
const App = () => {
  return (
    <MyProvider>
      <ChildComponent1 />
      <ChildComponent2 />
    </MyProvider>
  );
};

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

In the above example:

1. We create a context using `React.createContext()`. This creates a context object that has a Provider component and a Consumer component.

2. We create a provider component (`MyProvider`) that wraps the child components (`ChildComponent1` and `ChildComponent2`). The provider component sets the value that needs to be shared through the context using the `value` prop.

3. The child components (`ChildComponent1` and `ChildComponent2`) consume the context using the `useContext` hook. This allows them to access the value provided by the parent provider component.

4. Finally, in the `App` component, we use the provider component (`MyProvider`) to wrap the child components that need access to the context value.

With this setup, both `ChildComponent1` and `ChildComponent2` can access the value provided by the context without the need for prop drilling. This is especially useful when you have multiple components at different levels in the component tree that need access to the same data.

By using Context, you can avoid passing the value through props manually at each level, simplifying the code and making it more scalable.

Please note that this is a basic example to demonstrate the usage of Context. In a real-world scenario, the context value can be more complex and can include functions or objects.



Certainly! In React, you can use a `Fragment` instead of a `div` when you need to group multiple elements without introducing an additional wrapping element. Here's how you can use `Fragment`:

1. Import the `Fragment` component from the React package:

```jsx
import React, { Fragment } from 'react';
```

2. Replace the `div` element with a `Fragment` component:

```jsx
<Fragment>
  {/* Your child elements */}
</Fragment>
```

Alternatively, you can use the shorthand syntax by using an empty angle bracket `<>` as the opening tag and `</>` as the closing tag:

```jsx
<>
  {/* Your child elements */}
</>
```

Here's an example of using `Fragment` instead of `div` to group multiple elements:

```jsx
import React, { Fragment } from 'react';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <Fragment>
      <h1>Hello</h1>
      <p>This is a fragment example.</p>
    </Fragment>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

Using `Fragment` allows you to group elements together without introducing an extra DOM node. This can be particularly useful when you want to avoid unnecessary nesting or when you need to return multiple elements from a component without a container element.
