`useMemo` and `useCallback` are two React Hooks that serve different purposes, but they can be easily confused due to their similar usage and memoization capabilities. Here's a comparison between the two:

`useMemo`:
- `useMemo` is used to memoize the result of a computation and cache it for future use.
- It takes a function and an array of dependencies as arguments.
- It recalculates the memoized value only if any of the dependencies in the dependency array have changed.
- It returns the memoized value.
- Use `useMemo` when you want to optimize expensive calculations and avoid redundant computations.

Example:
```jsx
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
```

`useCallback`:
- `useCallback` is used to memoize a function, particularly event handlers or callbacks, to prevent unnecessary re-renders of child components that rely on those functions.
- It takes a function and an array of dependencies as arguments.
- It returns a memoized version of the function.
- The memoized function only changes if any of the dependencies in the dependency array have changed.
- Use `useCallback` when you want to optimize and avoid creating new instances of functions on each render.

Example:
```jsx
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
  // Function logic
}, [dependency]);
```

In summary, `useMemo` is used to memoize a value and optimize expensive computations, while `useCallback` is used to memoize a function and optimize event handlers or callbacks. Both Hooks help optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary re-computations or re-rendering of child components.
