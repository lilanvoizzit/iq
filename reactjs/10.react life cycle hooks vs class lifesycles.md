In React, lifecycle hooks or lifecycle methods are methods that are invoked at specific stages of a component's lifecycle, allowing you to perform actions or update the component accordingly. With the introduction of React Hooks, the traditional lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` can be replaced by equivalent functionality provided by Hooks. Here's a breakdown of how different lifecycle methods are handled with React Hooks:

1. **`componentDidMount`**: The `useEffect` hook is used to handle the equivalent of `componentDidMount`. It is executed after the component is mounted and rendered for the first time.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  // Perform actions after component mount
}, []);
```

2. **`componentDidUpdate`**: The `useEffect` hook can also handle the equivalent of `componentDidUpdate`. By specifying dependencies in the dependency array, the effect will run whenever any of the dependencies change.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  // Perform actions when specific dependencies change
}, [dependency1, dependency2]);
```

3. **`componentWillUnmount`**: The cleanup functionality of `componentWillUnmount` can be handled within the `useEffect` hook. By returning a cleanup function, it will be executed when the component is unmounted or before the next effect is triggered.

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  // Perform actions on mount

  return () => {
    // Perform cleanup actions on unmount
  };
}, []);
```

4. **`componentDidCatch`**: The `componentDidCatch` method, used for error handling within class components, does not have a direct equivalent with React Hooks. Instead, you can use the `ErrorBoundary` component to catch and handle errors in the component tree.

5. **`getDerivedStateFromProps` and `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate`**: The functionalities of `getDerivedStateFromProps` and `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate` methods, used for managing component state based on props or capturing information before an update, can typically be addressed by updating the state directly within the component function based on the props received.

```jsx
const MyComponent = ({ propValue }) => {
  const [stateValue, setStateValue] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Update state based on prop changes
    setStateValue(propValue);
  }, [propValue]);

  return <div>{stateValue}</div>;
};
```

By using React Hooks, you can handle the equivalent functionality of traditional lifecycle methods in functional components. The `useEffect` hook is the primary mechanism for managing side effects, subscriptions, and state updates based on different lifecycle stages of a component.
