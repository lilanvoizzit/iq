Apologies for the confusion. If you want to use Promises directly instead of the Fetch API, you can create and handle Promises for your API calls. Here's an example:

```javascript
function fetchData() {
  const promise1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // API call 1
    // Simulating an asynchronous API call with setTimeout
    setTimeout(() => {
      const data1 = { message: 'Data 1' };
      resolve(data1);
    }, 2000); // Simulating a delay of 2 seconds
  });

  const promise2 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // API call 2
    // Simulating an asynchronous API call with setTimeout
    setTimeout(() => {
      const data2 = { message: 'Data 2' };
      resolve(data2);
    }, 1500); // Simulating a delay of 1.5 seconds
  });

  Promise.all([promise1, promise2])
    .then((values) => {
      console.log(values);
      // Process the data or perform additional operations
    })
    .catch((error) => {
      console.error('Error:', error);
    });
}

fetchData();
```

In this example, we create two Promises (`promise1` and `promise2`) to simulate asynchronous API calls. Each Promise is constructed with the `new Promise()` syntax and contains the logic for the respective API call.

Inside each Promise, we use `setTimeout` to simulate a delay before resolving the Promise with the desired data. In a real-world scenario, you would replace this `setTimeout` with your actual API call.

The `Promise.all()` method is used to wait for both Promises to resolve. It takes an array of Promises as an argument and returns a new Promise that resolves with an array of the resolved values from the input Promises.

Finally, we use `.then()` to handle the resolved values (data) from the Promises. Inside the `.then()` callback, you can process the data or perform additional operations. If any error occurs during the Promise chain, the `.catch()` block will catch the error and log it to the console.

This example demonstrates how you can create and handle Promises for multiple API calls and use `Promise.all()` to wait for all the Promises to resolve before processing the data.

In modern JavaScript, you can use async/await syntax along with `fetch` to write cleaner and more concise code for handling API calls. Here's an example:

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response1 = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data1');
    const data1 = await response1.json();
    console.log('Data 1:', data1);

    const response2 = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data2');
    const data2 = await response2.json();
    console.log('Data 2:', data2);

    // Process the data or perform additional operations

  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
}

fetchData();
```

In this example, we define an `async` function called `fetchData()` to handle the asynchronous API calls. 

Inside the function, we use the `await` keyword to wait for the `fetch()` function to resolve with the response. We can directly call `.json()` on the response to parse the JSON data.

By using `async/await`, the code appears more synchronous and easier to read. The flow of execution is straightforward, with the `await` keyword indicating points where the code should pause and wait for the Promise to resolve.

If any error occurs during the API calls, it will be caught in the `catch` block, and the error will be logged to the console.

Using modern JavaScript features like `async/await` provides a more expressive and intuitive way to handle asynchronous operations and improves the readability of your code.
